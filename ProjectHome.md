# Introduction #
Introducing an OpenGL based cloth simulation code base. We implement all of the existing cloth simulation algorithms in as simplistic an approach as possible so that learners may know exactly what is needed to get a cloth simulation system up and running in OpenGL with a minimum of fuss. OpenCloth project has been initiated with a view that it may help beginners and researchers alike to implement the basic algorithms for cloth simulation using OpenGL API. It is not intended as another library that you can plugin into your game engine directly. Rather, you can learn from it and then implement a technique or two in you own game/physics engine. With a little bit of effort, it should be straight forward to implement the discussed algorithms on other platforms and Graphics API. Focus is on how to handle the bare minimum required to implement the techniques. Rather than wrapping code into classes, we implement the whole code in a single source file.

## Tell us if OpenCloth has helped you in your research ##
If this project has helped you with your research or project, please let me know. I would like to know more about how the project helped. There are some issues related to the units of simulation used by OpenCloth. Currently, I am trying to consolidate these and hopefully the next release will take care of this.
